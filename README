Usage : 

1) Create [application].ini in ini folder, by duplicating cornac.ini
    Check the first section, that should be enough. 

2) at the root of cornac folder, run this command : 
./cornac.php -I [application]

3) Stand by ... some (probably) long time. 

4) When cornac says 'Done' : 
 a) go in your destination directory, HTML version will be there, starting with index.html
 b) link (ln -s) you web root to the 'web' directory in cornac, and then,
    point your browser to the good path (http://localhost/web) : 
    All should be there
 c) cd to auditeur, run ./inventaire.php and open the resulting .ods with Open Office
 
 
May be of interest :
+ scripts/tag/tags.php : a way to tags comments in the code
+ scripts/file2png.php : a way to represent file system as PNG file

Current version is DEV. 

Pre-requisite : 
+ PHP 5.3.1 (only tested on that version, may work somewhere else).
+ MySQL (should work on any version), or SQLite (not currently tested)
+ xdebug is used for certain debug display.
